# 1.2 - Basic Set Theory Definitions
###### Definition 1.1
- A set is an unordered collection of elements.
- $x$ in $S$ is written as $x\in S$, where $x$ is an element of $S$.
- Set builder notation: $$S=\set{\text{elements\quad:\quad conditions to be in the element}}$$
  For example, $\set{1,4,9,16,...} = \set{n^2\ :\ n\in\mathbb{N}}$.
- The empty set $\emptyset$ is the set with no elements.
- $A\subseteq B$ means that $A$ is a subset of $B$. This means that for all $x$, if $x\in A$, then $x\in B$.
- $A\cap B = \{ x\ :\ x\in A\text{ and } x\in B \}$
- $A\cup B = \{ x\ :\ x\in A\text{ or } x\in B\}$
- $A - B = \{ x\ :\ x\in A\text{ and } x\not\in B \}$
- $A$ and $B$ are *disjoint* if $A\cap B= \emptyset$
- If $A\subseteq U,$ where $U$ is the universal set, then the *complement* of $A$ in $U$ is $A^{c}=U-A$
- The cartesian product $A\times B=\{ (a,b)\ :\ a\in A\text{ and } b\in B \}$
- The power set of a set $A$ is $\mathcal{P}(A) = \{ X\ :\ X\subseteq A\}$
- If $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, \dots,A_{n}$ are all sets, then the union of all of them is $$
\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}A_{i} = A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup\dots \cup A_{n}
$$
- If $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3},\dots,A_{n}$ are all sets, then the intersection of all of them is $$
\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}A_{i}=A_{1}\cap A_{2}\cap\dots \cap A_{n}
$$
- The cardinality of $A$ is the number of elements or size of the set, denoted by $|A|$
