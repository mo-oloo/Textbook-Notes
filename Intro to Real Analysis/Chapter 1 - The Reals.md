# 1.2 - Basic Set Theory Definitions
###### Definition 1.1
- A set is an unordered collection of elements.
- "$x$ in $S$" is written as $x\in S$, where $x$ is an element of $S$.
- Set builder notation: $$S=\set{\text{elements\quad:\quad conditions to be in the element}}$$For example, $\set{1,4,9,16,...} = \set{n^2\ :\ n\in\mathbb{N}}$.
- The empty set $\emptyset$ is the set with no elements.
- $A\subseteq B$ means that $A$ is a subset of $B$. This means that for all $x$, if $x\in A$, then $x\in B$.
