# Textbook-Notes
Notes that I take of the textbooks I am currently reading

## What I'm Currently Working On
- Algorithms - Chapter 1 Recursion
- Long-Form Real Analysis - Chapter 1 The Real Numbers
- Differential Equations(Not implemented yet)
- Probability Theory (Not implemented yet)

For the list of books, see Textbook List below

## Textbook List
- Algorithms by Jeff Erickson: http://algorithms.wtf
- Real Analysis, a Long-Form Mathematics Textbook by Jay Cummings: https://longformmath.com/analysis-home

## Topics/Texts I Plan to Add in the Future
- Modeling Neural Circuits: https://github.com/RobertRosenbaum/ModelingNeuralCircuits
- Analysis with an Introduction to Proofs by Steven Lay
- Number Theory (Author/Publisher TBA)

Some of these planned topics are books and courses I will be taking in the near future, so this list is subject to change.

I apologize for any shitty formatting errors in either the PDF or Markdown files. I am using Obsidian MD to write my notes, along with MathJax for LaTeX. I then export them to a PDF within Obsidian, so the PDF version may not be updated and reflect what is written in the MD files.

I hope this repository helps future students in their studies!!
