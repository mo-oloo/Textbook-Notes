Notes that I take of the textbooks I am currently reading

Algorithms by Jeff Erickson: http://algorithms.wtf

I apologize for any shitty formatting errors in either the PDF or Markdown files. I am using Obsidian MD to write my notes, along with MathJax for LaTeX. I then export them to a PDF within Obsidian, so the PDF version may not be updated and reflect what is written in the MD files.

I hope this repository helps future students in their studies!!
